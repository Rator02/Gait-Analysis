i added a file description but i don't know where it went so.
the code basically reads a csv file as a pandas dataframe, calculates the sample rate of the data, plots the raw data, parses it through a butterworth filter 
(questionable, but some literature i've seen on Human Activity Recognition used a butterworth filter, so i'm using it, it's not hard to modify or replace), 
and then plots the filtered data.
download the entire "preprocessing" folder, copy it to desired directory, go to cmd and open that directory, "python main.py Acceleration_filename.csv" and the code works perfect
so far.
all the functions used are in preproc.py file in the "util" folder
